Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design (CIID) in India for 3 weeks. It was a whole new experience as I moved away from my routine work of building products only for consumers. Here I worked on projects that focussed on natural disaster rehabilitation, environmental pollution and inclusive child care mechanisms. I learnt about how design can create socially innovative solutions and impact millions of lives for a better cause. </p> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-fill flex-column width-40\"> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Duration</span> <span class=\"paragraph\">Dec 7 2018 - Dec 21 2018 (3 Weeks)</span> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Domain</span> <span class=\"paragraph\">Non Profitable Service Sector</span> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Done as</span> <span class=\"paragraph\">Summer School Projects</span> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"d-flex py-2 flex-fill flex-column\"> <p class=\"secondary-heading color-white\"> During the entire course of study, <span class=\"highlight-ciid\">double diamond approach</span> was emphasized to follow in every projects </p> <img src=\"b82abeb237f80d91701f802445797e57.png\" width=\"100%\" height=\"automatically\" class=\"py-4 image-fit-cover\" alt=\"\"> </div> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column pt-5 pb-3\"> <div class=\"d-flex flex-fill\"> <div class=\"d-flex page-content-padding position-relative\"> <div class=\"d-flex pt-2 position-absolute left-0 align-items-center\"> <span class=\"d-flex rectangle\"> </span> <span class=\"sub-heading pl-3 color-white\">5 Days</span> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column\"> <span class=\"sub-heading py-2\">Project 1</span> <div class=\"d-flex heading\"> <span class=\"pr-3\"> The </span> <span class=\"d-flex highlight-ciid px-1\"> Communion </span> </div> <div class=\"d-flex pb-2 flex-fill\"> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column width-60 mr-5\"> <p class=\"paragraph d-flex flex-fill pt-4 pb-2\"> The purpose of this project is to identify the major regrowth areas after the flood had affected the Kerala State in India. The loss of the state have been humongous and there is need for bringing back things to stable. There are lot of people who were affected both physically and mentally. We found that they need a lot of support to bring back to their daily livelihood. The study concentrated on the areas where we can provide better service for the victims such that they have a smooth transition during the course of the rehabilitation. </p> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-fill flex-column width-40\"> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5 pr-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Class Title</span> <span class=\"paragraph\">Intro to Service Design</span> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5 pr-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Team Size</span> <span class=\"paragraph\">6 Members</span> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-2 pr-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">SDG Goal</span> <a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030-goal13.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"button reference-link\">Goal 13: Climate Action</span></a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-fill flex-column mb-5\"> <img src=\"7a90356c266408d986bd9eaeb712767a.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" class=\"py-2 image-fit-cover\" alt=\"\"> <span class=\"paragraph-small text-right\"> Service Design Class - Batch Members </span> </div> <p class=\"paragraph d-flex flex-fill pt-3 pb-1\"> We began with the background study to understand the impacts the Kerala floods had created.

However, they are offended with many facilities inside their institution itself. We visited a Child Care Institution in Kerala to explore the situation they are facing. We found that Children in that institution are satisfied with all their primary needs except “food”. The study concentrated primarily on providing a better standard of food to satisfy the children and provide a healthy life. </p></div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-fill flex-column width-40\"> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5 pr-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Class Title</span> <span class=\"paragraph\">Design for Inclusion</span> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5 pr-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Team Size</span> <span class=\"paragraph\">3 Members</span> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-2 pr-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">SDG Goal</span> <a href=\"http://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030-goal10.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"button reference-link\">Goal 10: Reduced Inequality</span></a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-fill flex-column mb-5\"> <img src=\"795bee7e2109f08e6660481f780be6b8.JPG\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" class=\"py-2 image-fit-cover\" alt=\"\"> <span class=\"paragraph-small text-right\"> Intro to Inclusive Design Class - Batch Members </span> </div> <p class=\"paragraph d-flex flex-fill pt-3 pb-1\"> We spent half a day in this child care institution gaining insights from children who are put in here for more than 6 years.

However, when our team examined closely in various terminals, we found that ferry terminals are one which got affected most because of its difficulty in cleaning since most of the litters are being thrown into the water. We aim to solve this problem to contribute our little part to the United Nation’s one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Sustainable Cities and Communities. </p></div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-fill flex-column width-40\"> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5 pr-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Class Title</span> <span class=\"paragraph\">Design for Behavior and it's Impacts</span> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5 pr-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Team Size</span> <span class=\"paragraph\">4 Members</span> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-2 pr-5\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">SDG Goal</span> <a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030-goal14.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"my-2\"><span class=\"button reference-link\">Goal 14: Life Below Water</span></a> <a href=\"http://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030-goal6.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"button reference-link\">Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</span></a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"d-flex flex-fill flex-column mb-5\"> <img src=\"0332609adab8264757d8b91963a0a8d2.JPG\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" class=\"py-2 image-fit-cover\" alt=\"\"> <span class=\"paragraph-small text-right\"> Designing for Behaviors and it's Impacts - Batch Members </span> </div> <p class=\"paragraph d-flex flex-fill pt-3 pb-1\"> We visited Vypin Ferry Terminal, one the densely packed terminals in Kerala to understand the behavior of the people who are frequently using that terminal and identified the reason behind the littering.

So that, they have no other options, but to throw into the water.

Consider the entire job aspects. In our case, we considered other jobs done by the ticket collector in the boat apart from collecting tickets. While doing the behavioral diagnosis, considering the unnoticed behavior is of equal importance to that of a noticed one. Make sure your solutions don’t add new hassle factors. Try to embed them into existing behaviors. </p> </div> <div class=\"d-flex py-3 flex-column\"> <span class=\"sub-heading pb-2\"> Overall </span> <p class=\"paragraph\"> It was one of the best learning experiences in my life as each project comprised of people from educational background from different countries with different mindsets. Each people attended different workshops and contributed their previous learnings in their next workshop which I found very valuable. Since this summer school was attended during my employment, it was a whole new experience as I moved away from my routine work of building products only for consumers. This made me realize that design is the best method to solve problems that we haven’t faced in our normal life.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>  <script>function e(){document.querySelector(\"body\").classList.remove(\"nav-active\"),document.getElementById(\"nav\").classList.remove(\"active\")}</script> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"4d585f9387deb4b55fb2e184f5aa2ae4.js\"></script> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"acdfb3f6697e1c032d900459c4eadff7.js\"></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"0a8a1b8b64629872fdb023c53dad4604","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
