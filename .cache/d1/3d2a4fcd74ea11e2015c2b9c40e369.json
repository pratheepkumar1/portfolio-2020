the Copenhagen\n                        Institute of Interaction Design (CIID) in India for 3\n                        weeks. It was a whole new experience as I moved away\n                        from my routine work of building products only for\n                        consumers.

I learnt about how\n                        design can create socially innovative solutions and\n                        impact millions of lives for a better cause.\n\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"d-flex flex-fill flex-column width-40\">\n\n                    <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5\">\n                        <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Duration</span>\n                        <span class=\"paragraph\">Dec 7 2018 - Dec 21 2018 (3\n                            Weeks)</span>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5\">\n                        <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Domain</span>\n                        <span class=\"paragraph\">Non Profitable Service\n                            Sector</span>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"d-flex flex-column mb-5\">\n                        <span class=\"sub-heading pb-1\">Done as</span>\n                        <span class=\"paragraph\">Summer School Projects</span>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d-flex py-2 flex-fill flex-column\">\n                <p class=\"secondary-heading color-white\">\n\n                    During the entire course of study, <span class=\"highlight-ciid\">double diamond approach</span>\n                    was emphasized to follow in every projects\n                </p>\n                <img src=\"/b82abeb237f80d91701f802445797e57.png\" width=\"100%\" height=\"automatically\" class=\"py-4 image-fit-cover \" alt=\"\">\n            </div>\n\n\n\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"d-flex flex-column pt-5 pb-3\">\n            <div class=\"d-flex flex-fill\">\n                <div class=\"d-flex page-content-padding position-relative \">\n                    <div class=\"d-flex pt-2 position-absolute left-0 align-items-center\">\n                        <span class=\"d-flex rectangle\"> </span>\n                        <span class=\"sub-heading pl-3 color-white\">5 Days</span>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"d-flex flex-column\">\n                        <span class=\"sub-heading py-2\">Project 1</span>\n                        <div class=\"d-flex heading\">\n                            <span class=\"pr-3\">\n                                The\n                            </span>\n                            <span class=\"d-flex highlight-ciid px-1\">\n                                Communion\n                            </span>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"d-flex pb-2 flex-fill\">\n                            <div class=\"d-flex flex-column width-60 mr-5\">\n                                <p class=\"paragraph d-flex flex-fill pt-4 pb-2\">\n                                    The purpose of this project is to identify\n                                    the major regrowth areas after the flood had\n                                    affected the Kerala State in India.
